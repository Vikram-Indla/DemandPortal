   - QUICK_START.md
   - package.json
   - tailwind.config.ts
   - .gitignore

### Folders:
Download each folder separately:
- Right-click `src/` → "Download as zip"
- Right-click `supabase/` → "Download as zip"
- Extract all on your computer

## 📤 **After Download - Upload to GitHub**

### Steps:

1. **Extract** the downloaded file(s) on your computer

2. **Go to GitHub:**
   - https://github.com/demandportal/roadmap-dashboard

3. **Upload all files:**
   - Click "Add file" → "Upload files"
   - **Drag ALL files and folders** from extracted folder
   - Or click "choose your files" and select all

4. **Commit:**
   - Message: `Initial dashboard import - 6 specialized roadmap views`
   - Click "Commit changes"

5. **Verify:**
   - Check all folders appear: `src/`, `supabase/`

## 🆘 **Troubleshooting**

**Can't find the .tar.gz file?**
- It's in the root of your Replit project
- Scroll down in the Files panel
- Name: `roadmap-dashboard-upload.tar.gz`

**Download not working?**
- Try Method 2 (Download folder directly)
- Replit creates a zip automatically

**Folder too large?**
- Download folders separately:
  - src/ folder
  - supabase/ folder
  - Individual root files

**Can't extract .tar.gz on Windows?**
- Use 7-Zip: https://www.7-zip.org/
- Or use WinRAR
- Or try Method 2 instead
